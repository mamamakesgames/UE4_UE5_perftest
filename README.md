# UE4_UE5_perftest

This is a simple test project for comparing performance between UE4 and UE5. It consists of two levels, one completely empty and the other having a directional light, a navigable ground plane, and spawning 1,500 C++ based teapot characters on level start. A primitive UMG widget swaps between these levels.

To compare, clone the project, open and build in UE4. Then open it again in UE5, converting a copy, and build there. To just test the results on your own system, please check out the Releases. Thanks!
